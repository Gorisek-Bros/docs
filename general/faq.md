# Frequently asked questions

## Is creating custom hills hard?

No, if it goes about inrun and hill profile. Problems may start when you are trying to do building constructions, then you will need some time to understand how everything works.

## What are hill data resources?

There are a few.

* [skisprungschanzen.com](http://skisprungschanzen.com/) - the largest hill database in the world
* [homologations](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/ski-jumping/homologations.html) - official FIS homologations regarding real-world hills

::: tip
If you are following homologations when imitating real hill, small changes may be needed to fit with the DSJ4 playing style. Sometimes homologations also contain errors.
